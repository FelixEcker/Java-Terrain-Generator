/**
 * Java Terrain Generator
 * 
 * This Library contains a simple
 * 2D Terrain Generator based on Tiles.
 * The Generator will return a list of Tiles,
 * which represents the Generated terrain.
 * Due to the Fact that each type of tile
 * is stored in an HashMap should make it fairly
 * easy to port this Generator to other Objects/Classes,
 * although this is not provided by standard.
 * This "Library" (if you can call it that) will not be maintained,
 * there may be additions or bug fixes, but these are NOT
 * guarenteed.
