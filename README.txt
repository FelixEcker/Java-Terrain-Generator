Java Terrain Generators

This is a 2D Terrain Generator written by me in Java
out of boredom. It isn't really efficient nor special but
it is useful for simple games and other things which need this
terrain. It generates this terrain with ASCII characters and stores
them in a List. However, since the Tile Collection is stored in a HashMap
it can be easily ported to a interface for superclass for tiles.

This Project is licensed under the ISC license, which can be found in the
License.txt file, which lies in the same directory as this Readme.

Requirements:
The only Requirement for this "Library" of sorts is Java 1.8 or above.

Usage:
You can either directly download the Source and just drag the package
into your project or download one of the Jar Releases, if there are
any at the time of reading. Then simply add the Jar to the build path
and you should be able to import the Generator class and use any Generator
method from there!
